<h2>Who am i?</h2>
<p>My name is Aron Þór and i was born 1994. I started programming when i was 11 and since then i have much experience programming.</p>
<h2>Why am i doing this?</h2>
<p>There are three major reasons for why i am programming this framework, and this whole site. The first reason is to learn more about the MVC pattern and just making my own framework for future projects. The second reason is because i needed a website and since i know how to programm a website i wanted to make my own. The third and the biggest reason is that i am in a little bit of a problem you might say. I started programming when i was 11 and back then i had no access to any education except for the internet. So i learned everything i know from the internet basically. That did not give me any educational degree in any kind of programming since i can progam in java and php. I also have good knowledge on XML, Apache, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON. I also can work my way around with some other languages. I am making this website and framework open source on github too hopefully use this project on my resume when i apply for a job in web development.</p>
